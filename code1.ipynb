The story is threadbare and makes little sense as it goes from minor burglary to intense shoot outs and killings for no real reason.  The sub plots are meaningless and the dialogue is mostly laughable.  Pelecanos really struggles with writing in the present day.. he is much better with the 70's and 80's where he can show his knowledge of music and cars from those eras.  As a DC native I do enjoy the DC setting, but even that gets old and seems mostly to be filler in this book.  Look for very early Pelecanos books to read something really exciting.\",\n",

I found it too predictable, and there are lots of unnecessary scenes that slowed the story down. Too much scripture for one thing. I liked Lilly; she's a strong woman. The thing that really bothered me and seemed so out of character for Lilly was her hot-over-heels love for Paul. But then--suddenly--without enough story or explanation, she's google-eyed over Tern after looking into his eyes. I thought maybe I'd accidentally jumped ahead too far in my Kindle, so I went back. But no I hadn't. And I was disappointed in the ending. Again, the crucial part of the story was rushed. Too much of what the characters wore, etc. I would've liked more meat of the story itself.

It sounded to me like it was written by a group of high school girls but then I saw the writer was only 22 so guess that explains it.  There were so many things going on that caused me to scratch my head, thinking &#34;who does that?&#34;.  You expected one of the characters to react a certain way in a situation but their reaction would be something totally different that didn't make sense.  The dialog was off too - how many 18 year-old girls who live in a trailer with a stripper for a mother say &#34;whilst&#34; and &#34;amongst&#34;?  All the long, heartfelt declarations of love with her father and stepmother got really old so I just started skimming those.  It felt like &#34;how do I love thee, let me count the ways&#34;!The editing was probably the worst I've ever read and I read 6 - 7 novels a week.  Spelling errors, crazy punctuation, run-on sentences, extra words, missing words, incomplete sentences, grammar mistakes, you name it, this book had it.  And it wasn't like one error per page or something, it was multiple errors in each sentence.  I lost count of how many times I had to edit a sentence several different ways in my head just to figure out what was going on.Harley was the biggest mess of all.  That chick seriously needed to stay single and focus on growing up.  The fact that every time one of the guys cheated on her she wondered if it was her fault was so incredibly annoying.  Even more annoying was how quickly she would take them back, especially Jace.All that being said, I still couldn't put this book down.  I think it had the same appeal that a show like &#34;worlds fattest man&#34; or &#34;woman with three heads&#34; has - you don't want to look but something just draws you in, some sick fascination you can't resist.

The story itself is fascinating, but Winchester's telling does it a great disservice, in large part because he spends far more time than necessary on numerous parts of the story. I came away from this with the sense that there just wasn't enough for a book (despite the fact that this is a very short book and its font and size suggest a young-adult audience). Winchester apparently doesn't have the talent to turn what is an amazing story into an enjoyable book. One further annoyance: he refers on occasion to pictures, but there are no photos in the book. There are drawings scattered throughout the book, but they are unlabeled and serve no real person. The decisions about illustration just reinforce the sense that this is a shoddily conceived product.\",\n",

Seemingly pathologically oversensitive, and obviously on the make, Bob is hard to like or empathize with.  The novel bogs down at mid-point, the language increasingly prosaic, and plods forward somewhat interminably. As description of the LA ship yards during the war, the book's sociological value may equal the literary.

Oh my goodness I really loved this book, and if I hadn't had to go to work the next day after I started reading, I would have finished it in one sitting.  Yes, this book was that good!I was very hesitant in picking up this book.  It had been on my radar for awhile.  I had been told by friends that it's either hit or miss.  You either love it, or you hate it.  It depends on your style of reading.  Yes there are flashbacks.  Yes it's told from two characters points of views.  But I didn't find this confusing at all because the book is so short.  It's under 250 pages, so honestly I had no issues with keeping track of the shifting point of views and timelines.  I really felt like I was reading two stories in one.  And both stories kept me intrigued, and I loved both main characters.Mind Games tells the story of two sisters, Sofia (Fia) and Annie.  Both sisters have paranormal abilities.  Fia has an uncanny ability of having perfect instincts.  She's the type of person that could predict lottery numbers.  Annie is blind, but occasionally she has flashes that allows her to see into the future.  These sisters are tight.  They are very close.  And I don't know if it's because I have recently seen the movie Frozen, but it's so nice to read a book with a close sibling bond.  The young adult market is flooded with romance.  It's a nice change of a pace to see someone risking it all for a sibling.  Not that there isn't romance, because there is.  But the main story line involves the bond between two sisters.This is a story that needs to be told first person.  Seeing inside Fia and Annie's mind is just sheer brilliance.  Amazing.  The story flows so nicely.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if it was told from third person.  I needed to feel Fia's pain and suffering.  I needed to feel Annie's frustrations and fears.  Also I found both girls to be extremely likable.  I embraced Fia's snark.  I didn't find it annoying or unnecessary.  And Annie's guilt about not being able to protect her sister, even though she is older than she is really translated well to paper.I cannot wait to read the sequel Perfect Lies!

Liam, the hero who is in modern day Tennessee and is a musician, is the yin to Emily&#8217;s yang as they are an entertaining couple to read. The conversation between both of them had me turning pages because the dialogue was written appropriately for both time periods, giving the story that extra kick it needed to really pull someone into the scenes and become connected with the characters.I also loved the humor because Emily was very proper. It gave her an edge of wittiness without coming off as too naive in a modern time (because she had time-traveled to the future.) Liam had a Southern vibe about him that made him sexy and insecure without seeming inadequate to truly be the man for Emily.The twists and suspense in this story had me consistently intrigued. I could tell Bella enjoys suspense by the way she writes it. I am normally not a big fan of suspense, but this book did it for me because of the romantic elements and fantasy weaved throughout.

Second, I was really hoping Shea wasn't going to develop a romantic relationship with the coach but it went there.

So this book is Jenna and Jimmy\\'s story. Like all the other books, the POV trades off between them.At the beginning of this book, Jenna finds out she is pregnant from a one night stand. It wouldn\\'t be a big deal except that the author decides the identity of the father should be a \"secret\", even from the reader. However, the idea that we don\\'t know who the father is from page one, is laughable. It\\'s almost offensive the way the author thinks the reader is so obtuse that we are supposed to be surprised when the father is \"revealed\" around page 70.What\\'s more annoying is the vague dialogue used to mask the father\\'s identity (inner dialogue too!! Like the characters are keeping the information from themselves!! So stupid!!) and waffling behavior by both Jenna and Jimmy (though ESPECIALLY Jimmy). Truthfully, I couldn\\'t tell WHO Jimmy wanted to be with as he was talking about how he could easily fall back into a relationship with his ex, Chelsea, if she\\'d just say the word. That was on like page 20. Then all of a sudden, he\\'s been thinking about Jenna for months? What?Then they take a huge step for no reason. But then, there might be a reason. But then there IS a reason, they just didn\\'t know it. Maybe. This all happens in about ten pages. It doesn\\'t really invest the reader with any kind of faith in their feelings for each other. Or even make the reader care, at all, if they get together.Then there\\'s Jenna\\'s ex husband, who is evidently Batman, as he can not be captured or stopped even in a closed venue or small town while being actively tailed by police. And I just want to put this out there--has the author EVER been to a rock concert? Because they routinely search for cameras, drugs and weapons. Just saying.The other books weren\\'t works of genius but at least the characters were likable and their actions appeared to have some kind of logic to them. This book seemed to have been written by the author after staying up for five days straight, maybe with a hangover.Little continuity and even less possibility of engagement with any main character. The whole story was ridiculous from start to finish. If I hadn\\'t wanted to write this review, I would have tossed the book at page 40. Seriously.I would have given one star except in this book, this rock band finally--FINALLY--has an actual rock concert! Only took 500 or so pages. I\\'ve never seen a story about a famous rock band with so little actual music happening. They play gigs in a bar in their tiny town and practice a lot but that\\'s about it.And will we EVER know why the band is called 4225 West?? It\\'s a really specific name, suggesting history or an address or place of significance. So why are we never told WTH it means?? Also, if it means nothing, it\\'s a mouthful to say so not really great marketing technique on the band\\'s part.Did I miss this explanation? Please let me know, if so.In any case, I was just kind of so-so about this series until this book. Now, I\\'m sorry I read any of them. Waste of money and time.Hopefully, my loss is your gain. Don\\'t bother.One last note to all writers of rock stories out there: just because you wrote a book, and some of you have talent doing that, doesn\\'t mean you can write a song. It is an entirely different animal. I am tired of reading the horrible, poorly metered lyrics these writers churn out, as if someone is going to read it and produce their song. Please, just stop. Describe the song and lyrics and how it makes the character feel. But if you really don\\'t know how to write lyrics, then please refrain.Thanks.',\n",

       " 'Buchanan\\'s identifies four \"clear and present dangers\" to the future health of the western world. These are: 1) a dying population; 2) mass immigration; 3) rise of an anti-Western culture; and 4) the  breakup of nations and rise of world government.Looking at how these apply to the United States, where I have lived my whole life, I agree with Buchanan\\'s conclusion but not his reasoning used to reach that conclusion. It is clear that the U.S. is in serious decline, and the evidence for this shows up almost everywhere one looks these days. There is an epidemic of obesity in this country. No country can remain strong when its population is so unhealthy. Our health care system continues to sink in comparison to other countries. We spend twice as much as other countries on health care, with results that by any measure put us only about 30th compared to other developed countries.Our national government is completely dysfunctional, unable any longer to govern. We spend more on the military than the next 12 or 13 countries combined! We are addicted to military intervention in other sovereign countries, even though we would never tolerate another country doing the same to us. We seem unable to live within our means, both on a personal level and on a governmental level. The federal deficit still runs to unheard-of amounts, meaning our national debt is skyrocketing yearly.On a personal level, our savings rate has become negative for the first time in history. We seem unable to grasp the concept of deferred gratification; rather, we insist on having it all immediately. We evaluate ideas and programs and policies not on the basis of long-term benefit, but on the basis of what the immediate effect is of said plans.We incarcerate far more of our citizens than any other country in the world, contributing to the financial crisis we face. Our citizens are 20 times more likely than those in other developed countries to face gun violence, due to the epidemic of guns and gun-related violence in this country. We seem unable to do anything about this epidemic, even though 90% of us believe that better background checks are needed for someone buying a firearm.We have become a nation of whiners, rather than a nation of doers. It used to be that when we suffered a setback, we would resolve to work harder and pull ourselves out of the difficulties we face. Now, we look for someone to blame, even to sue. (A Little League coach just sued one of his players for throwing his helmet in celebration of scoring a game-winning run.)These are the kinds of reasons explaining America\\'s decline, not the xenophobic and homophobic reasons advanced by Buchanan. Buchanan says that the dying population is the \"most dangerous\" of his four cited dangers. And yet, he is opposed to allowing the immigration levels which would ameliorate the problem of the low birthrate. He is, however, strongly opposed to abortion and homosexuality, and part of the reason for his opposition is that these two issues contribute to the dying population problem.Buchanan abhors what he calls the \"de-Christianizing\" of America. He is unable to see the wisdom of the separation of church and state, and it is obvious he thinks the government should actively promote Christianity. This is an insidious notion in and of itself. However, the true problem with Buchanan\\'s position here is that it is not Christianity in general which he espouses; rather, it is a very narrow brand of fundamentalist and socially conservative Christianity, a brand which condemns birth control, abortion, divorce, homosexuality, feminism, artistic freedom, and the lack of prayer and Christian symbols in schools.The tragedy of this misguided book is that people who read it might be so turned off that they will then overlook Buchanan\\'s very excellent books on foreign policy. \"Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War\", and \"Where the Right Went Wrong\" are exceptionally perceptive books, full of meticulous research and well-reasoned criticisms of U.S. war policy. Readers should skip \"The Death of the West\" and instead immerse themselves in these other two books.',\n",

One day, a friend shared a story of her friend's daughter who had cancer. I chose not to look away, as too many do. What I watched over the next 4 years was heartwrenching and terrifying for any mother to even think of, let alone experience. I became determined to find a way to help, and got involved with many cancer families, and I have watched so many families struggle to cope with the death of their beautiful children..I've seen parents living in fear of the day they are told the monster is back..I've seen children nearly die from the side effects of their cancer treatments, and I've seen children DIE from the side effects. I know that the heartache I felt for them was not even a pinch of the pain they felt and feel today. I have worked for years with special needs adults and children..and while it is a hard road it is not an impossible one. Impossible is when you are told there is nothing left that can be done, impossible is watching your child die a slow, agonizing death. Cancer is nothing to say you wish your child had whether you mean it in a different way or not. This author should have thought twice about the families who have really been through cancer and are going through it. It's offensive and this is the worst title I've seen for a book.. Maybe your life is hard, but so many others have it harder. And you didn't need such an offensive title. Autism will not ravage your child's body the way Cancer does, and it certainly won't take their life.To mothers with children who have fought or are fighting cancer, I am so sorry this book exists..

       " 'Michael Cuneo\\'s ONE LAST KISS is the story of Chris Coleman, a man who strangled his wife, Sheri, and his two young sons, Garett and Gavin, in the early morning hours in the family home on May 5, 2009, in Columbia, IL, a suburb across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Coleman, head of security for Joyce Meyer Ministries and among the most soulless and heartless atrocities you will ever hear about was involved in a heated love affair with Tara Lintz a high school friend of Sheri\\'s, and the two had exchanged rings and a vow to be married as soon as Coleman was divorced. But Coleman feared that based on company policy, a divorce would mean he would be fired, and Lintz had given him a deadline of May 4 to file for the divorce. He lied to Lintz that he had filed on May 4, and proceeded to kill his family the very next day, clumsily attempting to make it appear that the killings were done by a maniac who despised him for his position with the Ministry, an attempt he had been setting up for six months by sending anonymous letters and e-mails to both the ministry and to himself threatening harm to his family. And to enhance the plot, after he killed his wife and sons, he spray painted obscenities around his house. His attempts to cover up his crime were so inept that no one in the region - the public or the cops - had any doubt after the first couple of days that Coleman was responsible.The story is an unimaginable and profoundly interesting one and the writer, Cuneo, has commendably done a lot of research and presents considerable background on the principals, which is unfortunately one of the few positives about the book. Cuneo had the chance here to produce an intelligent and reportorial study of the case. He did not. Rather he has written a chatty, breezy mediocrity replete with filler, repetition, fabrication, and a nauseating and never-ending lionization of police, lawyers, and judges.Some selected of many possible examples:For just plain sloppiness, consider that Cuneo states that at the time of Coleman\\'s trial, Illinois was \"experiencing its worst hurricane season in recent memory.\" I live in St. Louis, and can state without fear of contradiction that there has never ever been a hurricane in this region.And on more than one occasion, he presents incorrect time frames. As noted, the murders were committed on May 5th, 2009, the reason being Coleman\\'s narcissistic desire to be with Tara Lintz while losing nothing more than a family which was now a hindrance. On page 311, Cuneo writes that Coleman became infatuated with Lintz in the fall of 2009 and began implementing his plan and cover up in November 2009. If this were the case, Coleman would have murdered his family 5 months before falling for Lintz.The same thing happens when we learn that Sheri was born in 1977 and her brother Mario in 1975.  According to Cuneo, the family moved to Largo, FL, in 1978, at which time Sheri and Mario were 12 and 10 respectively. Unless the siblings suffered from progeria, a condition conspicuously absent from the narrative, this seems unlikely, and all I can say is, \"Nice editing.\"Repetition is rampant. Cuneo in the first chapter reports the findings, emotions, and preliminary observations of the cops and EMTs who are the first responders to the crime scene.  Later, in a particularly cynical example of increasing his page count at the expense of quality, Cuneo has two officers repeating this information to a later arrival at the scene. He could have simply written that \"they made the later arrival aware of their findings.\" But no, he repeats the information.There is a discrepancy in time frames that is important to solving the case. Cuneo reports and explains this discrepancy at least three times.Cuneo is also omniscient. On pg. 134, he reports that Sheri applied steroid cream to Gavin\\'s poison ivy. Besides being a prime example of irrelevant filler, my question is, with Sheri and the boys being dead when the book was written, how would he possibly know this and why would we care in any case?Cuneo reports on numerous instances of interaction - thoughts and conversations - between Coleman and his family. It is obvious that they didn\\'t cooperate with the author in writing the book. He simply makes things up as he goes along.Reporting on Coleman\\'s being interviewed by police, Cuneo reports him as \"sounding like a petulant nine-year-old accused by his parents of stealing from the cookie jar.\"A child, \"Austin saw the look in his mom\\'s eyes. He knew that she was telling him the truth.\" Give me a break! Fabricated, not to mention bad, similes and true crime don\\'t go together. He should be writing soap opera.As for Cuneo\\'s fawning idolization of almost everyone in the book other then Coleman\\'s family and a few others:\"Hadn\\'t (Chief Edwards) always encouraged the people working under him to go that extra step in solving crimes?\"\"At State\\'s Attorney Kris Reitz\\'s skillful prompting, the chief described the reams of evidence that the police had uncovered...\" How skillful does a prosecutor have to be to introduce prosecution evidence from a cop? But then Cuneo is incapable of not lavishing praise on that which is actually mundane.\"Judge Wharton proved a master of reasonable compromise.\"Sheriff Kelly is \"delightfully frank and witty.\"Kris \"Reitz was sharp, confident and single minded.\" He also \"wanted a conviction in the case...\" Maybe I\\'m jaded, but Reitz\\'s desired outcome would seem to go without saying, him being a prosecutor and all. Keep that word count rolling!John O\\'Gara, \"positively oozed compassion and humanity.\" And while this would make me personally not want to sit too close to him, we are also advised that, \"He had a slightly shambling look about him that nicely understated his sharpness of intellect.\"\"Baden was lucid and congenial.\"Even a local TV anchor and cameraman are described as being \"talented\" and an \"ace\" respectively.And finally, even the title, ONE LAST KISS, is nothing but soap opera, there being no way of knowing whether or not Coleman gave his family members a \"last kiss\" before killing them.I read another book by Cuneo called ALMOST MIDNIGHT. It was very good, professional and reportorial, so he is certainly capable of better, but here he has taken an interesting story that could provide a writer intent on doing an intelligent job with maybe 200 pages of material and turned it into a fictional/semi-true crime/soap opera crapfest. It has long been my contention that in the best of true crime, the reader is unaware of the author\\'s personality until he\\'s through with the book and then marvels at what a fine job he\\'s done. In ALMOST MIDNIGHT, Cuneo is omnipresent on every page.',\n",

       " \"The Brian Herbert-Kevin J. Anderson Dune books are quite polarizing. After having read the final book in this series, I find some of the criticism valid. But it's also clear that the authors did try to flesh out the Dune universe in a way that would satisfy Frank Herbert. They're clearly not quite as good with the art of writing, but the books aren't trash.As I've noted in my reviews of the other Dune House books, there is a lot of repetition and lack of subtlety in the writing. I'm not sure if this is because the book had two authors, but the book repeats itself as if worrying readers will forget. In House Corrino, I found the biggest problem to be that the book had too many disparate and sometimes interwoven plots, but little to make me care about many of them. By the middle of the book, you have dozens of characters running around starting wars, having babies, scheming, etc. The chapters are quite short, meaning that you jump around these various subplots quite a bit because every single subplot seems to climax at the same time. This happens a lot in Star Wars books and frustrates me to no end.And if you've read Dune, you know that none of it matters. Of course, this is an inherent risk with any Prequel as it's almost impossible to surprise the audience. But this is why authors who try to pen a prequel should focus on building character and depth than on plot twists. We know what has to happen, so why bother? Instead, a good prequel should tell the reader why they should care. Dune, as a single book, ironically feels like it had more depth than this book.With one exception. I did like seeing Leto Atreides becoming a leader. I thought making him an aggressive military commander was an interesting choice. The authors, as they did in the previous novels, did make him a bit too much of a goody two-shoes, but I do feel like the explanation for why he became so popular prior to the events of Dune makes sense.Ironically, despite the title, I didn't feel I'd gained much insight into House Corrino at all. Emperor Shaddam comes across as petulant and semi-retarded. This is not the same man who laid such devious plans in Dune and was so careful to hide his involvement in the downfall of House Atreides. Perhaps Shaddam grew wiser within the intervening years, but if so THAT is the story I would have wanted to read. Instead, in this book, we constantly hear Shaddam moaning about how he can make decisions without Fenring's advice (even when it's clear that he can't).Also, this book contradicts Dune in a major way. Paul is born on Kaitin, not Caladan, even though in Dune it's clear he'd never left his home world. Why? Why contradict Frank Herbert's masterpiece? Having Paul born on Kaitin added nothing to the story or his character.As this is the final book, I'm forced to ask myself if I should have read the series at all. I'd give the series as a whole 3 stars. There were some nice backstories, particularly for Gurney Halleck, Leto, and Count Fenring. But the books are just not well written. House Corrino especially feels like a triumph of breadth over depth - exactly the opposite of Frank Herbert's Dune books. I &#34;read&#34; these books as audiobooks while doing other chores, so overall I didn't exactly lose too much of my time with the books. For Dune fans, they'll perhaps give you a spice hit, but they won't inspire you to run out and get the next set of Dune books written by Herbert & Anderson.Overall: 2.5 stars.\",\n",

That is, people who think that if a movie or a book is not saturated with action, it is not worth their time. So, even when the story does not require an action sequence, Rollins inserts one. For discerning readers, the result is poisonous, agonizing pulp.Not only is the action excessive, much of it is implausible. The early boat chase on the Yangtze River? Not only can it be deleted without affecting the story, the end of the chase is silly. It is inappropriate for a serious novel, though fine for a comic book. Later on Rollins inserts a sequence reminiscent of John Wayne\\'s prominent Rooster Cogburn sequence in TRUE GRIT. The difference is that Rooster Cogburn\\'s is more realistic. And near the end of the book, we have a super-sandstorm that is miraculously cooperative. Its timing is too perfect. It seems to tell the characters, \"Tell me when I should arrive, to make your story suspenseful. If you need me to slow down a bit, be sure to inform me.\"The modus operandi of SANDSTORM--and I assume the other books in the series--is interesting. (It\\'s what sucked me in.)

       " \"** Spoiler Alert**First thing, I read this book as soon as it came out and debated on writing a review.  I was taught, if you can't say something good, don't say anything at all, but I just have to.  In all the books I've read, over 500 in the last three years, I have never been disappointed in the ending, until now.  I was so excited when I started this series, I read the first two books in two days, and before the third book came out I read them again, just as quickly.  I was drawn to it by Blane and Kat's love story, two lost souls who found each other.  Kade irritated me from the beginning, he was like a gnat that kept flying in your face and you just wanted to smack it. He claimed that he loved his brother so much, yet he had no problem putting the moves on Kat whenever he could, even though he knew Blane was in love with her.When the fourth book came out, I lost all respect for Kat and never had respect for Kade.  For someone who didn't want to come between the brothers, she sure changed her tune quickly.Before this book came out, I stayed away from reading anything about it, because I didn't want any hint as to who she chose.  So I was highly disappointed when I saw the table of contents, it told me who it was immediately, all it mentioned was Kathleen, Kade, and Kathleen & Kade, no mention of Blane.  I almost didn't even read the book.  Than, her being pregnant with Kade's kid , a quarter of the way in, I almost quit, but I continued but with a heavy heart, skipping parts along the way, just to get to the end.I understand that this was the only way to end it so that everyone could stay in each other's life.  Blane is the strong one and he can handle her choosing Kade, cause if she would have chosen Blane, Kade probably would have killed himself. What I don't understand is how Blane, the main character in the first books, turned out to be a secondary footnote in the last.  Why the knife had to be twisted in his back so many times (3 kids), just for one mistake in judgment, believing his uncle, the man who raised him.  Trust me, I would have believed him too, if I witnessed how Kat and Kade acted around each other.  This could have been avoided, if Kat would have told him what his uncle did in the first place.  I also think the relationship between Blane and Brenna is totally out of left field and an insult to our intelligence.I honestly do not see how Kade can be the better man for Kat.  He is a killer.  He killed 10 people, in cold blood, in the time he left her with Blane.  He shot her friend's boyfriend and would have killed him if Blane didn't show up, just cause she wouldn't tell him where Kat was, with no repercussions.  I'm so tired of how he could get away with doing and saying anything he wants, just because he was so abused as a child and his poor pitiful me, I don't deserve love act.  I think no matter that he put the word out that he was dead, someone will find out he's alive and will be looking for him and they will be watching their backs constantly.  What a life for their children.The only good part in this book, was the time spent with Blane.  He was so sweet to her.  I'm sad, cause he really loves Kat, and will always be there for her; and will live his &#34;content&#34; life, and probably never love again.I think there should have been alternate endings, and you choose which one you want.  I just downloaded a book like that, but haven't read it yet, I'll have to.I'm sorry that a series that started great, ended with a thud!!!!!!!!!  No warm fuzzy feeling for me!!!I will read future books, because I think Tiffany is a good writer, but not Kade's story, I've had just about enough of him that I can stomach!\",\n",

Like the book on Debt by David Graeber,  the author has a particular economic point of view , yet my own readings and subsequent central bank actions after the 2008 collapse seem to support his thoughts .  You will trace money/currency from the earliest times ( the stories are fascinating)  right up to present day and its dependence on credit, trust and credibility. . He does make sense out of why economists missed the collapse of banking/credit etc.  You will learn how the credit support of national government was needed to prop things up , that as it stands the govt is still taking all the risk and none of the upside - leaving the financial industry able to make bets and only have an upside , no downside. He gives  ideas from history that show how we can improve the system in each nation state and internationally, with the goal of a stable prosperous economy with benefits for all.

Not that I was looking for blatant smut but I was hoping for character depth, sexual tension, and perhaps giving in to some passionate feelings like kissing and such. The only sexual scenes are of torture and attempted rape.  It is extremely short and not well written. The dialogue is contrived at times, characters underdeveloped, and there are contradictions throughout that confuses the reader.

       " 'Mrs. Richmond\\'s learning approach in this Spanish Vocabulary book is excellent, but she indulges in writing about moral issues that serious-minded Christians would find repulsive... which greatly mars this volume for me.In workbook format, this volume starts with the alphabet and pronunciation basics, good for beginners and good to review for those who have forgotten Spanish from high school days, but it moves quickly into grammar.A GREAT bonus with this workbook is the answer key at the back, a very practical help for those who are independent learners.Dorothy Richmond\\'s methodology is geared for practice, but in such a way as to make the learning delightful, like a table game ( in small steps ) that helps the learner to REMEMBER it.When teaching \"Yo soy... \" ( I am , which is used for an UNchangeable \"to be\" condition ) , she omits the explanation and replaces it with amusing and interesting sentences in which the learner must use YO SOY several times ... and will remember the condition too !For instance, to teach YO SOY  and DE ( of )  , she would say something like this, in Spanish:I am LA AMIGA ( the female friend ) DE  Mickey Mouse. ( So, who am I ? )The LEARNER responds on the exercise sheet: Yo soy Senorita Minnie.Thus, the learner practices reading YO SOY  ... DE....  and writing YO SOY ( son, daughter, friend, etc.).... using YO SOY in UNchangeable conditions !So, the exercises are fun, interesting, and entertaining. No drudgery whatsoever with doing Mrs. Richmond\\'s exercises.The exercises include interesting facts from many popular areas:  sports, entertainment, current events, historical events, etc.However.......  being a serious-minded Christian, I winced at some of the afore-mentioned items she has put before her students\\' eyes. She makes references regarding Harry Potter as easily as she does  Adam and Cain and Abel. She has many \"interesting\" exercise sentences which include homosexuals and \"their\" off-spring ( ?).She makes reference to husbands and wives and their \"ex\\'s\"... yes , all a part of the sad reality of western civilization,  but do these unsavory and ungodly and sorrowful situations need to be put before a student\\'s eyes as though the situations were NORMAL ?The students from broken homes whom I have taught during my teaching years were never at peace about their sorrowful situation with one ( or both ! ) parent /s  missing.  Something ALWAYS seemed missing from their lives and they looked yearningly upon the \"other kids\" who had NORMAL homes, with a Mom and Dad.For any such student who is from a broken home, or is the off-spring of an illicit affair, such reminders of the sorrow of their lives seem totally un-necessary and really, out of place in a language study book.Surely, there are enough clean-living personalities who are sufficiently well-known  that Mrs. Richmond and her student helpers COULD have chosen to omit the seamier side of life, just for once.How about Joan Woodard and Paul Newman, for starters, in the entertainment world ?( I cannot recall any clean-livers in the current political world, at the moment, but there might be some... )It so distracts from the intrinsic worth of the volume, that I am sad I purchased it.... and sadder that such a promising volume would be un-fit for Christians to learn an amoral subject like the Spanish language.It is a SAD commentary on the academia in this civilization who have allowed such \"realities\" of the unclean, baser side of life to darken, deaden, and clutter the learning resources, exercise books, and text books of this age... all  of which are put before the impressionable minds and hearts of the learners.Clean is BETTER.Yours for an un-reproachable conscience before GOD and man...Sr. Judith Hannah  + + +',\n",

Any sort of conflict or excitement in the book is quickly glossed over and goes no where.This book should have only taken a day or two to read. Instead, three painful weeks later, I've finally finished.This author- I mean main character has major daddy issues. The father tricks her into working the books at his strip club and she immediately rationalizes it by saying he's the smartest, bestest man alive so those strippers are super lucky to work for him. Ummmm... Overall that relationship gave me the skeeves.You know why the main dude mistook you for your father's stripper girlfriend? Because your relationship is weird and gross.The story is told in very short, yet over detailed sentences that insert the authors personal traits to come off as a quirky, unique butterfly but it reads as fan fiction to herself.November loves dresses. November took sewing classes to make her own dresses. She wears a dress every day. Dresses can be accessorized with a jacket or earrings. November loves wearing them with flip flops. Ok, and?November took a shower. She forgot her conditioner in the car. November scolded herself for leaving her conditioner in the car.And on and on it goes, whether it's about November's love for coffee, November pumping gas, November and her favorite blue jeans that are so dark they're almost black but they're definitely not black so don't mistake them for black.She listens to rap music! She wants to go mudding!

You can save yourself time and money by reading the teaser chapters or perhaps you'll decided it's for you. The h interviews for a job with the world famous, reclusive author, who has come to live in her small town to get away from the press. She's up against her 2 best friends, who never said anything to her. It's one of the most immature things I've ever read. I felt like the story should have been set in high school. The way the H and h interact throughout the book, is like 2 teenagers, who alternate between talking and not talking to each other. I'm never a fan of a character who is in another relationship whilst the story is developing between the leads. We read about her having sex with her boyfriend near the beginning and the relationship continues through a large part of the book. It was tacky and verged on cheating.

I understand that this is a series and it's going to answer each question like where is Allie and is she going to come back, and where and what is going on with Greta (Josh's sister) in each of their own stories I just thought we could have got a bit of a wrap up. I would have liked more of a conclusion between Devon and her dad and also with Josh. It kind of just ended with her revelation and didn't show the future or anything which I really enjoy a the end of the books I read. This book just ended very abruptly for me and unfortunately that negatively affected my overall outlook on the book.I don't think I will read Allie's story because I already don't really like her. I mean okay she ran off on her wedding day and that's a dick move to someone you claim to care about but I was more upset with the fact that she dated her best friends ex-boyfriend. She was fully aware how those two felt about each other but she decided to date him and then get married to him in less than a year and asked Devon to be at the wedding. All of those things are just not okay in my book. Especially when she clearly wasn't in love with Josh, I think that makes it all the more worse.So unfortunately for me my questions will remain unanswered when it comes to this series.\",\n",

       " \"This review applies to &#34;Space Vengeance&#34;, book three in the Scrapyard Ship series as read on Kindle.In my previous review on &#34;Hab 12&#34;, I indicated the Author was vacillating entirely too much between actual &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; and Fantasy, and should tighten-up his story-telling; this he has failed to do, and in fact has grown worse.&#34;Science&#34; entails the study of known, provable phenomena; whereas &#34;fantasy&#34; does not. &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; postulates scientifically POSSIBLE phenomena which does not yet exist, but may at some point in the future should our scientific knowledge make it so. Too much of what Mr. McGinnis puts forth as &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; is actually &#34;fantasy&#34; since the known laws of science make it impossible. Entertaining fantasy, but NOT &#34;Sci-Fi&#34;.Additionally, I am left to wonder how much (if any) actual military experience Mr. McGinnis has. I am sure that I am not the only veteran who laughed at the ridiculously naive ideas the Author displays as to how the military, especially the Naval branches, work.When you couple the above mentioned military ignorance with his obvious left-wing political bias, which he really makes apparent in this book, you have one man's fantasy about a world and &#34;multiverses&#34; he wished could exist, but never has or will. I mean really... The &#34;Montana Militia&#34; backing a rogue FEMALE Admiral's attempted coup to overthrow the government?!  Laughably ridiculous! The Author seems to know even less about militia groups (especially that one), than he does about the US military! Such propaganda narratives are blown apart by the simple fact that it has been the Leftist extremist groups such as &#34;Red Flag&#34;, the &#34;Weathermen&#34;, and the so-called &#34;People's Liberation&#34; armies of men like Mao, Lenin, and Castro, who throughout history  have been responsible for the bloodiest coups in man's history. How many violent coups have the American militia groups ever attempted? ZERO. How many have Leftist? Numerous.I think it despicable when Writers of a genre of literature, which should be safe from political propaganda use it as a pulpit to propagate their own twisted mis-characterizations. Mr. McGinnis - If your readers want to entertain a political treatise, there are much better source Authors they could resort to. I, like so many others, buy Sci-Fi books seeking a temporary escape from such ugly real-world  concerns. It violates the whole intent of such escapist literature to inject your own political biases into it, much like defecating in the swimming pool; and soon you'll find good folks electing to swim elsewhere.You want to air your views on politics? Fine, but do it within that genre where it may be properly critiqued as such, and rebutted by others.Finally, whereas the Author seems to be a Leftist in other respects, he certainly embraces capitalism where his own financial interests are concerned. These books are becoming thinner (both literally and figuratively) with every issue, and it does seem that the Author is attempting to &#34;milk it&#34; for all he can. No &#34;Tolkein&#34; is he, for sure.I was probably a sucker to buy his third installment in the vain hopes that things would improve; they haven't. So, this will be my last purchase from this Author.I hope others will find this review helpful.\",\n",
       " \"Fantastic, simply fantastic!!  In previous books of the Blood Curse series, we have read of how the Jaegar vampires (Dark) treated innocents and even their own people, it is beyond cruel, horrendous, or atrocious, but this is how Saber was raised and has lived for 800 years; now he has been told he was stolen and raised in the wrong house, that he is really a Jadon vampire (Light), how can he just change overnight to become someone else and Vanya (the destiny of Saber and our heroine) what she had been through, how she had been coping with becoming the person she thought she should be for herself and her people, but inside her heart wishing she could become the person she wanted to be.  The continual angst that Saber mind was always going through was a deep-down heartfelt thing to read along with the continual battle of Vanya struggling with who she wanted to become.  Ms Dawn wrote Saber's character and story so you can actually feel his torment and anger coming off the pages and could see the slow change taking place in Vanya; it is one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  My recommendation, read the previous books in this series, become familiar with the two different vampire factions, you will become totally engrossed with Ms Dawn's unique take on vampires that make up the storyline, and the Blood Curse series will become one of your favorites.\",\n",

I admit that I haven't followed the Fantastic Four very closely for the past few years. I know that Jonathan Hickman made quite a few changes to the general cast of characters when he was writing the book, but I had no idea the book was largely dominated by children, now. And where are the original cast members? What is going on? Sure, I like She-Hulk, but not really in a team book. And the rest of these characters are D-listers, as best. I certainly don't pick up a book like Fantastic Four to read about adventures of children and their reading-glasses-wearing purple dragon nanny. Why are there mole men in the Baxter building? Why is one of them a decapitated head? Why is one a cross-dresser? Aren't mole men asexually grown clones to begin with? And who is this old Johnny Storm character with the burned face and gaping eye socket where his eye should be? Not only was I completely lost while reading this, the stories were not engaging and even off-putting.

This gets easier as the book moves along because the names and locations become more familiar, but to truly understand the first half of the book, one must read it again with the accumulated knowledge of having read the entire book.

If you read a lot of cheap Kindle editions, it becomes very hard to keep them straight. Seems like every other book has Aurora in the title.  Stop the Madness!Anyway, despite the title, I LOVED the book.  The chapters with the two main characters are simply fantastic.  The chapters without out them do seem to drag on a bit, but they are necessary to build up the political structure that the author then sets on fire and watches it implode.I have to be honest, one of the things I really did enjoy was the incredibly steamy sex scene.  It is so enjoyable to read it from a female author's point of view.  It's so different from all the male oriented crap that fills the cheap Kindle pages.  Here, the author focuses on taste and scent, whereas for a guy, it's usually about looks and feel.  I found the shift in perspective delightful, and the entire episode is so well written, with such vivid intensity and tremendous emotional highs and lows and risks and fears and exquisite joy and anguish.  It's just superb. I even made my wife read it :-)The technology in the book is...appropriate to the story line.  The integrated quantum communications link is sort of taken for granted and not explained (and how can quantum comms be disrupted by a nebula????), but generally, there are no glaring issues, and as stated, it helps establish the story, not subtract from it.  I'm totally in with where she is going on the tech side.I was disappointed in the length of the book.  As the author's first foray into this world of self-publishing, I can see wanting to dip a toe in the waters, but I am hating the trend of never finishing a story line and stringing it out into volume after volume (three in this particular case).  I miss the good old days when an author would write a book, with a beginning, middle, and end.Nonetheless. I look forward to Jennsen's continuation of this particular story, though how she can keep up the quality of Chapter 47 remains to be seen....\",\n",

Episode 5 had no significant typos or confusing sentences; maybe one so I would call it perfect.The action slows down. Some parts become a bit boring, but this is science fiction and explaining or rather giving examples of how a fighter would train for space engagements is par for the course. As everything has slowed down there is more reflection on how long they have actually been out in this particular part of space which I feel adds needed perspective. Also contemplating their actions as their main duty is to get back to earth keeps fresh in one's imagination how far this series still has to go.The characters are developing and changing through their experiences which keeps the human factor alive. Some of the back stories on the characters could have been written more dynamically. For instance a man cutting open his chest out of loyalty, just don't state it describe it more graphically to add some real gut wrenching.There is a great emphasis on tactics and politics which adds to the reality of this world the author has created.

Yet again, there is not much written about her in Scripture so I should have realized this before picking the book up.The author explores all the Scripture where Mary of Bethany is mentioned. There is then a lot of information that may or may not relate to those texts specifically. There was one specific section that discussed prayer and was critical of some other Christian authors that I was uncomfortable with. Yet then later there was a big emphasis on grace and the cross.

       " 'Originally posted on The Canon! [...]The gorgeous book cover strikes again: The Thinking Woman\\'s Guide to Real Magic was beautiful on the outside and overwhelmingly underwhelming within the covers. Get some popcorn. We might be here a while.THE CHARACTERSI went into this book with a little bit of a misconception: I believed the protagonist would be a thinking woman. Strangely enough, English doctoral student Nora is anything but. She is stuck in a rut in her dissertation, her love life (her boyfriend ran off to marry some other woman) and she is thoroughly intimidated by her doctoral adviser, Naomi. Nora, essentially, has no backbone; she keeps this passive attitude throughout the story, letting the overworked plot pull her in every direction without showing an ounce of personality.Aruendiel, the magician that saves her life, has a bit more personality, but it is shown more often than not that women should stay in their place (shown in his attitude not only toward Nora, but Mrs. T, his housekeeper, as well as his fellow magician Hirizjahkinis (try to say that three times fast). He has a sort of charm in a gruff, cranky way, but it was overshadowed for me by his past (which could be considered a spoiler, so I won\\'t go into detail. For those who have read this: seriously? That\\'s a plot twist?).Ilissa was appropriately evil and her son, Raclin - Nora\\'s \\'fairy\\' prince - had all the creep factors: as soon as his character appeared in the scene, the hairs on the back on my neck stood up. There wasn\\'t enough plot or character development to fully understand any of these characters, beyond their basic motivations.THE PLOTI almost returned The Thinking Woman\\'s Guide to Real Magic to the library because the first fifty pages of the novel were absurd. Nora, upset from her discussion with her adviser and discovering her boyfriend is engaged to another woman, decides to hike up into the hills with a copy of Pride and Prejudice in her pocket while everyone else is sleeping. We are constantly told about her disdain for the novel (which made me like her a little less - P&P; is one of my favorites), but The Thinking Woman evolves in more ways than one into a shadow of Austen\\'s work. Nora then, within these fifty or so pages, becomes enchanted by fairies, meets, marries and is pregnant with the increasingly creepy (that\\'s the only word for him), Raclin. There\\'s five hundred plus pages in this book. Couldn\\'t we pace it out a little more?Neither the boyfriend nor the adviser ever cross Nora\\'s mind again; the dissertation is merely a faint thought in the back of her mind. Nora barely thinks of her family and friends during her visit to the \"other world,\" something I find unbelievable. Her lack of backbone and constant passivity during not only her captivity with the evil fairies but her time with Areundiel is just irritating. Isn\\'t she the \"thinking woman\" of the title?The Thinking Woman\\'s Guide to Real Magic has many tiny plots that a) aren\\'t resolved or b) don\\'t have any impact on the story whatsoever.  Discovering Aruendiel\\'s rather interesting love life had no impact on the plot. The romance mentioned in the book\\'s blurb is nothing more than feelings which neither truly acts upon. The potential was there, but after reading about Areundiel\\'s past, I just couldn\\'t handle it.THE WRITINGHonestly, this book is simply too long. The issue with pacing was overwhelming. Half of these five hundred pages weren\\'t necessary to the plot; more often than not, they were pages and pages of characters telling me how they feel instead of the author showing me. I want to see the characters develop instead of reading about Nora and Areundiel sitting in a dark room in the castle talking about it.The writing, in general, was okay. Barker created interesting atmospheres and moods that are more memorable than the characters. I was intrigued by the fairy world and Areundiel\\'s castle, but it wasn\\'t enough to make up for the book\\'s other faults.THE VERDICTNot for me. I was truly disappointed in The Thinking Woman\\'s Guide to Real Magic. The wooden characters, poorly constructed plot and bad pacing made the 563 pages feel like a struggle rather than a pleasure. Nora\\'s lack of personality and her passive state made for a protagonist I couldn\\'t bring myself to cheer for.',\n",

Another reviewer said she had read thousands of books and if she had to keep5 this would be one ,so being an a thousand reader myself I thought no doubt it had to be good! FAR FROM IT ,in fact it is the first time i have read a book where i could not remember the title nor what i read every time i put it down.The female is the worst person you will probably ever read about ,apart from the fact that she is a GIANT contradiction, she supposedly is a 26 year old virgin who has fend off unwanted attentions from lords and turned down proposals of marriage yet she is all over the hero as if she is a practised courtesan , she rambles on and on and on how the hero's intended is a great girl yet has no qualms messing about with another girls man, her excuse they are not yet official ,really ? She then stands up for the girl but calls her a simpleton to the hero ,and gets cross at the girl for showing a lively nature finally .Lala (the intended) is so much sweeter and kinder than the heroine very reminiscint of Lady Diana and Camilla , the heroine being the latter ofcourse.The author was going for a comparison where the heroine was supposed to be vivacious intelligent lively compared to the shy timid simple girl the intended was supposed to be ,BUT what she got was a nasty piece of work ,loud mouth ,know it all , floozy,vapid kind of like the girls all guys want to f:::;; but can't stand them the next day they open their mouth , though Lala was attractive too she was not loose much more of a women than the sleeze of a heroine, who cared for no one but herself,another contradiction as she blamed her parents for that I guess the apple fell under the tree ,while Lala was caring and really very considerate and sweet. It seemed the hero was really thinking with his .... When picking between the two! Lala would have definitely made him a better wife whereas the heroine could definitely sleep with his best mate in the long run ! At times she pretends decorum the next it is out the window , she decorates to impress the upperclass yet has no qualms to participate in a discussion of willies in front of supposed ladies .The scene where she a marquesse's daughter and a duke and another lord were chatting and laughing and had made Lala feel left out was so nasty again it reminded me of Camilla making fun of Diana when the latter knew she was with her husband ,I thought the Hero was a bastard , how is it he fit in and Lady Lala did not????which he bandied about every chance he could ,not that it was taboo then in that era???also he keeps saying he was bought up in the streets when the duke had taken him just a toddler.My final disappointment was how conveniently Lala's story played out ,by far the imagination in this story was lacking! The romance and sensuality ,leading up to romance scenes ,were by far non existent and the sex scenes a giant perfunctory yawn where the next day everyone carries on as if nothing happened . It was so boring i never had time to return it ,what a waste of money ,all i can say is if this is one of the 5 one reviewer would keep i can't imagine what her portrayal of sensual sexy romance is? Also this awful female claims a child her own an ruins herself then lies on a bed with hero's best friend for the night and he has claimed her as a wife , which of these two would ever happen in that era ? The fat ridiculous book of contradictions does not stop there , the hero sob story of how he was forced to dive into the muddy Thames to retrieve items of value and how he would kill his abuser for risking his life and that of other boys come to another eye rolling ridiculous result , when the hero begs and pays his friends to do exactly that again to retrieve a pouch lost over 10 years ago in muddy Thames for this stupid female!? Oh and  forgot to mention she is the inventor of the elastic band and Lala the stethoscope , roll your eyes ridiculous!\",\n",

       " \"Think Hunger Games meets Maze Runner.  Clearly this was written for the younger readers, so adults may not like it that well (I didn't).  There is an intriguing plot - those on the north side of the &#34;Frontier&#34; (wall) have electricity, and those on the south side don't but would do just about anything to get it.  I found the two main characters to be somewhat shallow.  Phoenix seems mostly wimpy, while Star remains a bit of a mystery throughout the book. You don't learn that much about her in book one.  Maybe her character gets developed more in the next book.This is the first book in the trilogy, but I found that it doesn't really come to any kind of conclusion - leaving you to buy the next book to find out what happens next. I typically don't read trilogies for that reason - it just seems like a marketing ploy to get you to buy more books. I get that. I was hopeful that book one would come to some kind of conclusion, but it doesn't.The plot has enough mystery to keep you guessing, but I found some weaknesses in the story.  No electricity for decades, but as soon as you are exposed to it you know how to use mobile phones and social media (including typing) like you've been doing it all your life?  Really?  Okay, perhaps in the post-electric world you found an manual typewriter and learned to type - maybe.  I don't get why no one from the south didn't try crossing to the north during while the wall was being constructed.Overall I did not like the story.  You can't really call it a romance story and there really wasn't much romance to it.  It seems to be more about unrequited love. Also, it's got a similar theme as in the Hunger Games, but no where near the level of writing.  There's not much dialog in the story.  The story unfolds from Phoenix's point of view, and most of it is about what he is thinking.I'm not going to bother with the other books in the trilogy.  The book left me with an &#34;I don't really care&#34; feeling when I finished it.  Perhaps younger readers will get more out of the book than I did.\",\n",

Mara is the main character, and other notable characters are Miyuki, Chris, Alex and Miles. Mara&#8217;s past is riddled with dark mysteries, from how she escaped her home to how she fled away from her brother. She&#8217;s a little on the dark side as far as teenagers go &#8211; she&#8217;s tough, not afraid to fight anyone who stands in her way, but she&#8217;s also quite depressed, and blames herself for a lot of things that happened to her. She hasn&#8217;t had the easiest childhood, and the effects of the abuse follow her today.It was hard to sympathize with Mara at first. I thought she&#8217;d gone through something bad in her childhood, but had no idea was. It was only when it was made clear, that I began to truly feel sorry for her.Mara and her friends each control and element. Mara&#8217;s element is fire. She&#8217;s spent her whole life hiding her abilities, but when the other members of her group tell her they have similar abilities, she begins to realize she&#8217;s not the only one with certain powers. But when a loner is forced to work together, things start to get hectic fast, and Mara has to fight against her own nature and learn to work with others.

When her brother returns to town, Mara will have to overcome her fears fast, before he damages her even more than he already has.I mentioned before how hard it was to like Mara at the start, but her bad girl &#8211; attitude grew on me as the book progressed.

I hadn't realized aromatherapy was anything more than just something that smelled nice at the day spa. After reading this my mind is a whirl with ways to put essential oils to good use with aromatherapy, particularly the ones it listed for help with headaches.Everything presented in the book is clearly presented and easy to understand.

U won't regret it.This is a continuous of Revenge 1 and also leaves u hanging  with a cliffhanger.This book had me giggling like a teenager and had me at the edge of a off waiting to fall. There is this love hate relationship between Dylan and Jess. One minute Jess wants to kiss Dylan, the next she wants to get far away from him. Will the things they do destroy them or bring them closer together. There was Times ( if I could) I would of slapped one or both of them up side the head.I can't wait to read the next part of this story, to see what comes up or goes down with Jess and Dylan.

The whole mom suicide was not very authentic and to be honest it wasn't necessary. Logan and Jordan were pretty much the same character. I hoped to write a better review but I wanted to be honest. The changing of points of view were very distracting as this author writes Drake and Chloe very much alike. Mannerisms, nuances, etc. The actions/reactions were cliche' and predictable.

       " 'ARC provided by Bolero Books via NetGalley for an honest review.First I want to say that this book intrigued me because it is about one of my favorite subjects &#8211; DANCE.  I love dance in any form, from folk dancing, ballroom, line dancing, krump &#8211; heck, name it and I love it.  If it is set to music and it makes your body want to get up and move, get lost in the rhythm and become a different person for 5 to 10 minutes, count me in!I enjoyed the premise of this book, I recognized some of the fictional characters that the author based her story on, even down to their specialty.  I&#8217;ve been a Dancing with the Stars fan and view since season 1 and I have my favorite Pros &#8211; one of which is a very good friend of the author, Cheryl Burke.  I&#8217;ve also read Cheryl&#8217;s book, Dancing Lessons, which I recommend if you are a DWTS fan.The author herself is a &#8220;recovering&#8221; dance competition dancer herself with a degree in English Lit.  I Googled her Bio before I started writing my review to see what her dance background was because the tone of the book did have the feel of someone that has been involved in the dance world.  I was just surprised that she didn&#8217;t include more history or technical aspects of ballroom into the book.  It could have been woven into the story very easily to teach those out there that have a moderate interest a little bit more about the world of ballroom and what EXACTLY judges are looking for when they score.I can understand that the dance world can be a very cut throat world &#8211; but I honestly think at the end of the day, the dancers do treat each other as family.  Face it, they are in a position that not many people can understand the world that they live in day by day.  In each family you are going to have your fights, yelling matches and making up &#8211; it&#8217;s how the world goes round, folks.Only thing I really didn&#8217;t like about the book and why it got a 4 star instead of a 5, is because the story was disjointed.  The way the author set the chapters up, it felt like there were big pieces of the story missing in between.  I did enjoy the Interludes, where the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of each dance is described &#8211; I thought that was a wonderful touch.  I&#8217;m also used to switching between characters from chapter to chapter when reading a book, but with this book, I felt that the writing was a little stiff and left out a whole piece of the picture.  Instead of getting a full story, I felt like I was only getting snap shots, little peeks into their life &#8211; so it left me feeling like I was reading Cliff Notes instead of an actual novel.All and all I did enjoy the book and do recommend it for anyone that is a Dancing with the Stars fan.',\n",
       " \"Mr. Hicks does know how to spin a tale. Unfortunately, the tale is stale. Firstly, the book belong more to the fantasy genre rather than to SF proper. Thus it is absolved of making any sennse in terms of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, etc. One has to accept that alien females are perfectly sexually suitable to human males. Whoah! What a relief!! The author tries to make us sympathetic to the alien culture's focus on death and cruelty. I cannot find any warmth for this idea and I wonder how Reza, the hero of the book, does almost unquestioningly.  The hero spends 40 years or so on the alien planet while a war-to-the-death is going on between the two species. Unsurprisingly (?), despite all his loved ones having been wiped out by this war, not a word is said about it. The hero and his alien love intermix their blood, but none exhibit any side effects of this strange transfusion. And so on...Moreover, the writing is rife with corny expressions that should only appear in parodies, if at all. I, for one, will not read the sequels.\",\n",

First, it is very well written and edited, so there is no wincing as he discusses his adventures, reminisces on his past, and gives advice to, well, practically anybody.  I grew up in an age where it literally was a kid's dream to become an astronaut, so I can understand his childhood fascination (obsession?) to get into space, even at a time when there were no Canadian astronauts.  He worked very, very hard to make it into these ranks, and the book focuses in large part on his suggestions for others who have dreams.  Work hard, study hard, don't be a braggart, practice, practice, practice...  Really, is there anything in life that wouldn't be improved with this focus... swimming, cello, chemistry, or parenting?But the focus really is an insiders guide to being in space as an astronaut.  Hadfield spent time on both the Space Shuttle and on the International Space Station (ISS).  When does Joe and Jane Public get a chance to visualize life in space, real space, not the sci-fi variety?  For most of us, this is as close as we will get.  Take advantage of this, to slip the surly bonds of Earth...\",\n",

Mostly everyone one in our world has all the necessities they need.Gwen Jones came up with a solution to the problem. She made ethanol in a still from corn. After the super hurricane trucks could not drive through the flood, she decided to plant fruits and vegetables. Gwen said that the world was ending and the new world was beginning.

The first book was kind of iffy, but the 2nd and 3rd really caught my attention. so far the 4th book is my favorite even though two of my favorite characters died. I'm just happy it wasn't Tellius. The 5th book has been a great book so far and I'm very intrigued to read more of it soon. Thank you for the Prologues and Epilogues. They were very cool and the book would be a lot harder to understand without it. Never ever stop writing this series and im dieing to read more of it soon.One of the many readers of The Gateway Chronicles,KristinP.S. Whoever illustrates the covers is a genius!\",\n",

Scenes jumped so quickly I had to keep looking back to see if I missed something.

Their being forced to work together will bring new confrontations, but will also bring to the fore emotions that have been bubbling under the surface all these years.If you like your romance with a touch of madcap comedy, then this is the book for you!

Mya Fanci delivers the latter packaged in a nice assortment of erotic tales in the short story series Spicy Collection Volume I.  The book includes:The Best Friend's BoyBench PressRanch HelpTexas TakeoffThe Roommate's CallTruth Be ToldNurse CareRoslyn ManorThe Slow ThawRoyal RendezvousThe stories are what one might consider as erotica for women.  Each tale is a fantasy come true for many readers out there, and the author sets the tone appropriately with the first story, My Best Friend&#8217;s Boy.  In it, a MILF named Stacey is surprised when her best friend&#8217;s son returns home on holiday from college looking like a completely different person.  He&#8217;s blossomed into a handsome young man who isn&#8217;t afraid to go after what he wants.  She soon discovers that the erotica she enjoys reading isn&#8217;t the only place where lovers make each other&#8217;s dreams come true.

Admittedly, my favorite is Truth Be Told, where patient and doctor confidentiality is of the utmost importance with two attractive neighbors.Spicy Collection I is tastefully done with sexy scenes that get straight to the point.  With 10 stories back to back, you&#8217;ll find yourself excited, maybe too excited, to finish.  This would be very awesome for couples who want to spice up their lovemaking, or a confident woman getting in the mood alone.  I would recommend it erotic fans who are more into the intimacy, and not necessarily the stories.\",\n",

He never knew unconditional love until he was an adolescent, and it did not come from a family member but from a &#34;servant&#34;/ teacher.

And he was, to an extent.  But it soon didn't matter as the suspense mounted and I was furiously turning pages.I do note that this is more of a thriller than a mystery.  The author tells the story from several points of view, including the criminal.  So the suspense is in seeing how all these threads will come together and if and how the police will prevail.

Glad to say, she was added. At first, it was a little slow to get to the action, but once we got through the mutual attraction that each of the hero/heroine wasn't aware that the other felt it was smooth sailing. The physical description of the scars on Christian made me wince at times such was the author's ability to be precise without becoming morbid. We begin with our hero, Lord Markham, an Adonis come down to earth, returning from the battle at Waterloo, shunned by the same society who once worshipped him, he now has to pay for his pleasure. During one of his forays, he's accused of a heinous crime against a debutante. Forced to flee, he vows to return to England and clear his name. Lady Serena Castleton, daughter of a duke and a beauteous debutante, is literally &#34;sold&#34; in marriage to settle her father's numerous gambling debts. She finds out the hard way, that her marriage is no fairy-tale as he subjects her to heinous acts of depravity. Knowing she has to escape or die, she makes a break for freedom and answers an add for a governess to Lord Markham's ward..Lily. The author skillfully takes us on the journey back to England which is not without it's dangers. Lily cannot allow him to know who she really is especially since she has loved him from afar for as long as she can remember. The emotions that are evident between these two are so steamy as to make one blush. You can almost envision being an actual witness as they fight to protect each other, Christian from whomever wants to ruin him and Serena from a man bent on reclaiming his property.  With friends who stand by them, Ms. Evans takes you on an enjoyable ride and lets you peek into the world of the titled and wealthy.

       " \"I love a dark mystery, but the construction of the plot and the weak characters kept me from enjoying this book.Obstensibly, this is the story of a detective who is investigating a series of asphyxiation murders.  The targets are beautiful young women.  However, the decective does very little investigation.  He attends a couple of autopsies, but we don't get to see any of the sleuthing that is the usual hallmark of the genre.  If he investigates anything about the women's lives of what they have in common, readers never find out.  Instead we have a bit of &#34;Keystone Kops&#34; style detecting courtesy of a computer dating magnate and his IT man (they determine that the young women were all clients and try to determine who the killer is before the news gets out and wrecks their bottom line).  The detective spends most of his time worried about his personal life and none of his interactions seem particularly authentic.  And the way the author wraps up the plotline about his personal life left me scratching my head.Despite the fact that the author introduces us to a woman who is, presumably, a future victim of the killer, there is no real suspense or thrills here.  There are too many characters and their charactization is shoddy.  We don't care about the detective, we don't care about the dead women, we don't care about the rich man, we don't care about the coroner, we don't care about the potential victim -- every time I thought I'd run out of people to not care about, Hudson introduced another character.  The tension in their lives (cheating spouses, angry bosses, drunk drivers, etc) never comes into focus.It seems as if the investigation portion of the novel is so uneven because Hudson might not understand that much about investigation and killing, a serious issue in a serial killer procedural.  At one point, we're told by a supposed expert that the reason why the killer creates such elaborate asphyxiation scenarios for his victims is because he mistakenly believes it will heighten their sexual pleasure.  Given the amount of sexual and physical abuse the victims sustain and the fact that we're told he repeatedly revives them prior to finally letting them die, I think it is far more likely that the killer was a sadism, determined to bring his victims pain -- not pleasure.  Errors like this can be quite jarring and made me feel like I was reading an underresearched book.\",\n",

He&#8217;s just about to land the title of youngest partner in his uber successful Washington D.C. law firm and he couldn&#8217;t be happier.  Of course, this is just another stepping stone in his plan to enter the world of politics.  He&#8217;s also managed to keep his nose clean and the skeletons out of his closet his entire life in prep to take The Oval Office one day.  This brings us to the present&#8230;when he heads to Las Vegas with his friends and ends up in bed with a Vegas showgirl and absolutely no memory of why she&#8217;s here.  Or what he may have done the night before.  Will &#8220;what happens in Vegas&#8221; actually stay in Vegas?  Never has Teague needed it that saying to be more true than right now&#8230;.You could say that Risa Clay has taken the lemons life has handed her and made them into lemonade.  She didn&#8217;t have an easy childhood but has managed to make a pretty good life as a Las Vegas Showgirl and can&#8217;t really complain.  She certainly can&#8217;t complain when she wakes up to a sexy stranger after an unforgettable night.  But that&#8217;s just what she&#8217;d have to do&#8230;forget him.  Her best friend was in trouble and she had done last night as payment to her boss for borrowing money to help her best friend kick a nasty drug habit.

It&#8217;s this chemistry that prevents her from doing the last part of the payment for her boss and sends her fleeing Vegas&#8230;and showing up on her handsome one-night stand&#8217;s doorstep.So I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230;.these boys can come back to my town any time they&#8217;d like.

Well, you know what they say about the best-laid plans.  Risa is exactly his opposite, a girl with a messy past and just living in the moment.  And this brings me to another saying: opposites attract! Fate has slammed these two together and never before has she gotten it more right.  Risa and Teague are so amazing together.

       " 'The book cover and title are magnificent, the contents are not.  While readers who are new to the NYC culture will find the general details in the book somewhat interesting, I suspect that the more seasoned ones will conclude otherwise. I was drawn in by the possibility of receiving a broad understanding of what goes on in the \"underground economy\" of NY. Instead what I got was a narrow synopsis of the author\\'s interaction with a few people in the world of drugs, prostitution, and porn videos.Though the author notes at the end of the book that this is just his memoir, the contents lack a lot of things that a reader would want to know- general information on the history of the NY underground, some stats on what the underground really consists of, greater details on the wealth/poverty divide, etc). Instead what we get is prolonged details of shallow events and conversations. The book seems more like one that (as the author implies a few times) was meant to keep him busy with a project at a difficult time in his life.One element that I felt uncomfortable with throughout the book was the author\\'s statement that he needed to be non judgmental when interacting with the underworld. Odd to use ones profession and academia as a crutch when the kinds of activities that the people he interacts with are destructive to self and society. How does one walk away from human interactions like this as if it were an experiment/analysis conducted in a lab? Should one even do such experiments/analysis? Undoubtedly his work will inspire others to pursue the same line of investigation. But I would suggest that this is best left to the NYPD who surely have a much deeper grasp of the NY underworld and whose purpose is much more nobler - the maintenance of law and order in Gotham. Maybe the NYPD should write a book on the NY underground!',\n",

Now, I can only shake my head with frustration and sorrow. I don't like to give 2 star review to this book, especially since its obvious that Ryan, alongside with Sanderson and Rothfuss is the top notch fantasy writers of our time. But I hope that he and his publishers will read these reviews, and re-think the direction of future books!- Tower lord introduced multiple new point of views, whilst Vaelin only got a few shallow chapters, the story focuses strongly on new main characters.- It was very hard to remember all the new characters names, creating lots of confusion. As a reader we encounter lots of battles and tragedies, ultimately failing to create any emotional reaction.- Whilst Blood Song felt almost unnaturally well written, sucking the readers emotional invest into every page and character, Tower Lord does none of this. Instead it feels like we're introduced with lots of side stories and page filling story arches.I remember reading somewhere that Ryan had already finished writing the whole series before publishing Blood Song. My educated guess says that the publishers wanted to stretch the story, make more money and forcing Ryan to re-write his drafts on tower lord, becoming this George R.R. Martin alike standard clone. Why try to mimic George R.R. Martin now, when Blood Song has already shown to be much better..? I sincerely hope that Tower Lord will be republished in the version Ryan wrote as a self published author!Greetings from Finland.\",\n",

I felt too much explanation was given on the last book that wasn't even hinted on the previous ones. I do think a lot of it could have been utilized earlier in the story and not have to rush everything for the end.On e other hand, I did like how Four came down from the pedestal and joined the rest of the world, but thought extreme and unnecessary. Did appreciate the fights and doubts on their relationship, making it more real to me, but again I felt it was to extreme and too dull.

       " \"This odd and pretentious novel is based on the true case of an innocent man who falsely confessed to a series of homicides. The nation is on edge in the wake of a series of mysterious disappearances. The targets, all older, solitary sorts, vanish and their presumed abductor leaves nary a clue but for a marked playing card. Oda Sotatsu is a young man living a life both unfulfilling and uninteresting. That is until he meets a troublesome couple, the supposedly charismatic Sato Kakuzo and his girlfriend, the alluring,Jito Joo. Clearly disturbed, they play games and place wagers where the loser has to physically harm himself. They attach to Oda, inducing him into  a wager after plying him with alcohol. After losing the game, he signs a detailed confession admitting culpability in the disappearances. Joo delivers the confession to the police and Oda is soon arrested, imprisoned, abused, tried and convicted. He is subsequently sentenced to death by hanging and executed, remaining silent throughout the whole ordeal. Enter journalist Bell who is drawn to the mystery while still pondering the dissolution of his marriage. The book is largely a series of transcripts of the bewildered and dismayed family members, interrogations, newspaper coverage of the trial and finally with Joo and Kakuzo.This book felt half baked.  The transcript style of telling the story contributed to the unfinished feel. The story lacked suspense and mystery but it was far from a searing condemnation of the Japanese justice system. Obviously a confession is the gold standard in Japanese jurisprudence because there was really no evidence that a crime was committed, much less that Oda committed one. Oda's behavior and refusal to speak or defend himself was inexplicable, even if one factors in traditional concepts of honor. Joo and Kakuzo fail to trigger the fascination that classically destructive couples do. They are not Sid and Nancy, Bonnie and Clyde or even Romeo and Juliet. They are boring and shallow. The ending is a total disappointment making the sacrifice and I use the term loosely of Oda's life stupid and meaningless.This could have been an examination of false confessions or an indictment of the death penalty. It could have been a haunting character study that addressed  the relevance of honor in modern society. The spare writing contributed to a dream like atmosphere but muted even the horror of the gallows. Oda remained a cipher. Despite the cool cover, this book was no more than two hundred plus pages of self indulgence. Pass.\",\n",
