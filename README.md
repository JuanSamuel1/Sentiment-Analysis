## About The Project

Sentiment Analysis maybe a daunting project to build. Firstly introduced about 20 years ago, sentiment analysis has gained huge popularity and has been used widely in various domain, such as market research, risk management, etc. Using different kind of methods, the model can help us to decide important problem.

From the dataset of book review bought in Amazon, I try to make a model to classify between a nice and bad review. Subsequently, I create a web that show the demo of the model and host it at Heroku. You can view the simple website in this link: https://sentiment-analysis-amazon-book.herokuapp.com/
<br>Note: It may take a long time to open the website as the server is started when there is a request (I think!)

It is very challenging to make this project! The hardest part of this project are deciding which machine learning algorithm to use for this problem and deploying it in Heroku.

Lastly, I would like to remind you that this project is still far from perfect as the accuracy of the model is only 80% ðŸ˜ž, any comment or suggestion to improve this project will be highly appreciated.
